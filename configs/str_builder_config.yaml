    Build the following uppercase string as 5x5 block letters on a 2D plane (z is constant).

    String: {text}
    Difficulty: {difficulty}

    WORLD bbox (inclusive):
    - from: {world_bbox_from}
    - to:   {world_bbox_to}

    Coordinate mapping (absolute coords):
    - Let (min_x, min_y, min_z) be bbox.from and (max_x, max_y, max_z) be bbox.to.
    - x increases from min_x to max_x (left to right).
    - y increases from min_y to max_y (bottom to top).
    - z is constant (min_z == max_z).

    Available blocks (use ONLY these):
    {block_agent1_lines}

    Constraints:
    - Output ONLY Minecraft commands, one per line.
    - Allowed commands: /setblock, /fill
    - Deletion is allowed: use /setblock ... air or /fill ... air to remove blocks.
    - Use absolute integer coordinates only (no ~).
    - Build ONLY the letters. Do NOT build a background/canvas.
    - Place exactly one empty column between adjacent letters.
    - Every coordinate must be within the bbox.

  # Optional overrides used when collab.num_agents=2.
  user_template_agent1: |
    You are Agent 1 in a 2-person Minecraft building team. You will place SOME of the blocks for the final build.
