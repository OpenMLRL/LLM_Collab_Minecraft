prompt:

    You are a Minecraft building agent.
    Output must be Minecraft commands only (no markdown, no code fences, no extra text).

  # Single-agent prompt.
  user_template: |
    Build the following uppercase string as 5x5 block letters on a 2D plane (z is constant).

    String: {text}
    Difficulty: {difficulty}

    WORLD bbox (inclusive):
    - from: {world_bbox_from}
    - to:   {world_bbox_to}

    Coordinate mapping (absolute coords):
    - Let (min_x, min_y, min_z) be bbox.from and (max_x, max_y, max_z) be bbox.to.
    - x increases from min_x to max_x (left to right).
    - y increases from min_y to max_y (bottom to top).
    - z is constant (min_z == max_z).

    Available blocks (use ONLY these):
    {block_agent1_lines}

    Hint (random rows):
    - Rows shown: {hint_rows_desc}
    - Letter coords to fill in hinted rows:
    {hint_coords_agent1}

    You must also fill letters in non-hinted rows.

    Constraints:
    - Output ONLY Minecraft commands, one per line.
    - Allowed commands: /setblock, /fill
    - Deletion is allowed: use /setblock ... air or /fill ... air to remove blocks.
    - Use absolute integer coordinates only (no ~).
    - Build ONLY the letters; leave other cells empty.
    - Every coordinate must be within the bbox.

  # Optional overrides used when collab.num_agents=2.
  user_template_agent1: |
    You are Agent 1 (letters). Place ONLY letter blocks using black.

    Task: Build the uppercase string as 5x5 block letters on a 2D plane (z is constant).
    String: {text}
    Difficulty: {difficulty}

    WORLD bbox (inclusive):
    - from: {world_bbox_from}
    - to:   {world_bbox_to}

    Coordinate mapping (absolute coords):
    - Let (min_x, min_y, min_z) be bbox.from and (max_x, max_y, max_z) be bbox.to.
    - x increases from min_x to max_x (left to right).
    - y increases from min_y to max_y (bottom to top).
    - z is constant (min_z == max_z).

    Hint (random rows):
    - Rows shown: {hint_rows_desc}

    You must also fill letters in non-hinted rows.

    - Use absolute integer coordinates only (no ~).
    - Build ONLY the letters.
    - Every coordinate must be within the bbox.

  user_template_agent2: |
    You are Agent 2 (background). Paint ONLY the background using white blocks.

    Task: Build the uppercase string as 5x5 block letters on a 2D plane (z is constant).
    String: {text}
    Difficulty: {difficulty}

    WORLD bbox (inclusive):
    - from: {world_bbox_from}
    - to:   {world_bbox_to}

    Coordinate mapping (absolute coords):
    - Let (min_x, min_y, min_z) be bbox.from and (max_x, max_y, max_z) be bbox.to.
    - x increases from min_x to max_x (left to right).
    - y increases from min_y to max_y (bottom to top).
    - z is constant (min_z == max_z).

    Available blocks (use ONLY these):
    {block_agent2_lines}

    Hint (random rows):
    - Rows shown: {hint_rows_desc}
    - Background coords to fill in hinted rows:
    {hint_coords_agent2}

    You must also fill background in non-hinted rows.
    Agent 2 acts after Agent 1, so do NOT paint letter coords.

    Constraints:
    - Output ONLY Minecraft commands, one per line.
    - Allowed commands: /setblock, /fill
    - Deletion is allowed: use /setblock ... air or /fill ... air to remove blocks.
    - Use absolute integer coordinates only (no ~).
    - Build ONLY the background.
    - Every coordinate must be within the bbox.
